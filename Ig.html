            <h1>Normal Green Iguana</h1>
            <h2>One OF My Favourite Iguana Color</h2>
            <p>COMMON NAME: Green Iguana<br><br>
SCIENTIFIC NAME: Iguana iguana<br><br>
TYPE: Reptiles<br><br>
DIET: Herbivore<br><br>
AVERAGE LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD: 20 years<br><br>
SIZE: 6.6 feet<br><br>
WEIGHT: 11 pounds<br><br>
SIZE RELATIVE TO A 6-FT MAN:<br><br>
			  Green, or common, iguanas are among the largest lizards in the Americas, averaging around 6.5 feet long and weighing about 11 pounds.

			  <h3>In Captivity as Pets</h3>
They are also among the most popular reptile pets in the United States, despite being quite difficult to care for properly. In fact, most captive iguanas die within the first year, and many are either turned loose by their owners or given to reptile rescue groups.

			  <h3>Range and Habitat</h3>
			  The green iguana’s extensive range comprises the rain forests of northern Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean Islands, and southern Brazil. They spend most of their lives in the canopy, descending only infrequently to mate, lay eggs, or change trees.


			  <h3>Behavior</h3>
Primarily herbivores, iguanas are active during the day, feeding on leaves, flowers, and fruit. They generally live near water and are excellent swimmers. If threatened, they will leap from a branch, often from great heights, and escape with a splash to the water below. They are also tough enough to land on solid ground from as high as 40 feet and survive.

			  <h3>Defensive Adaptations</h3>
Iguanas' stout build gives them a clumsy look, but they are fast and agile on land. They have strong jaws with razor-sharp teeth and sharp tails, which make up half their body length and can be used as whips to drive off predators. They can also detach their tails if caught and will grow another without permanent damage.</p>

            <h1>Normal Red Iguana</h1>
            <h2>They are also common iguana like normal green iguana.</h2>
            <p>The red iguana is a member of the Iguadnidae family that has seen a tremendous gain in popularity due to its unique red tint. What many people do not realize is that the red iguana is a variation of the common green iguana. The red color is the result of a selective breeding process focused on the manipulation of the color gene. Coloration can vary from a slight red or orange hue to a bold red color, all with black stripes or shading that tends to darken on the tail. The underside of the red iguana will typically have some traces of green, although the amount can range from a few small spots to an entirely green lower half.</p>
